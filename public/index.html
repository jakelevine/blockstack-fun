           <div class="text_slide h1">
              <h1 class="landing-heading">WTF is a decentralized app?
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              This is a <div class="d">decentralized</div> application that will guide you through the basics of a <div class="d">decentralized</div> application.
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              Today when you use an app, any personal information you share in that app is owned and stored by the company behind that app.
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              What happens to that information — whether it's sold to third parties, or compromised in a security breach, is outside of your control.
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              That's because most apps are <div class="c">centralized</div>. In other words, your information is sent to the company at the <div class="c">center</div> of the application.
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              But now there's a new idea.
           </div>
           <div class="text_slide h1">
              What if instead of sending all of our information to the center, applications came to us?
           </div>
           
           <div class="text_slide h1">
              What if we took control of our information and had a larger say in how it was used?
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              That idea is called <div class="d">decentralization</div>, and here's how it works.
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              Unlike in <div class="c">centralized</div> apps, where your information is stored somewhere else, in <div class="d">decentralized</div> apps, your data is stored on your computer or your phone.
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              (That's right, the one you're using right now.)
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              So if a third party — an advertiser, a government, or a hacker — wanted to get information from an app with thousands of users, they'd have to hack thousands of computers, instead of one <div class="c">central</div> location.
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              So the first thing you'll need to do, is set up your computer to be able to store your personal information. That's where Blockstack comes in.
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              Blockstack is a place to discover <div class="d">decentralized</div> apps, and a sets up secure place on your computer to store your personal information.
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              So before we move on, please <a href="https://blockstack.org/install" class="d">download and install Blockstack</a>.
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              Now go ahead and set up your Blockstack account. I'll wait...
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              ...
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              Alright great, now we're ready to go.
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              Surprise! This little explainer is also a <div class="d">decentralized</div> app.
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              This website is actually *running* on your computer. It's a pretty simple website, but the cool thing about it is that there's no information being passed back to some <div class="c">central</div> location.
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              So let's say that you wanted this app to know who you are. In a traditional <div class="c">centralized</div> app, you'd create an account with that app, and hand over a bunch of personal information like your email address, maybe your physical address, your name, phone number, or worse.
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              But in this <div class="d">decentralied</div> app, that is *running* on your computer, when we ask for your personal information, it never leaves the device in front of you. It never goes to some <div class="c">central</div> location.
           </div>

           <div class="text_slide h1">
              Blockstack makes asking for your personal information, and ensuring that it runs only on the computer in front of you, easy. So let's sign in!
           </div>
